   - Maintains all functionality (loading state, disabled state, etc.)

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Minimal Color Usage**
- Removed unnecessary blue, green, purple accents
- Used neutral grays and blacks for most UI elements
- Color only used where semantically meaningful (success/error states)

### 2. **Consistent Typography**
- `tracking-tight` for titles instead of `font-bold` or `font-semibold`
- Creates more sophisticated, modern look
- Better visual hierarchy

### 3. **Yellow Highlights**
- Used sparingly for important page titles
- Provides visual interest without overwhelming
- Applied pattern:
  ```tsx
  <div className="bg-yellow-200 w-[width] h-6 -mb-7 ml-1 rounded-sm"></div>
  <h1 className="text-2xl tracking-tight relative">Title</h1>
  ```

### 4. **Standardized Components**
- All buttons use shadcn/ui `<Button>` component
- Consistent variants: default, outline, ghost
- Consistent rounding: `rounded-md` or `rounded-lg`

### 5. **Non-Intrusive Features**
- Get Thoughts button appears naturally in content flow
- Doesn't interrupt user experience
- Opens chat widget smoothly without jarring transitions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Integration
The Get Thoughts feature leverages the existing memory system:
- Uses `memoryService.semanticSearch()` for collective memory
- Contextualizes content within DAO discussions
- Provides insights based on historical patterns

### TypeScript & Type Safety
- All new components fully typed
- Proper use of refs and forwardRef
- Interface exports for external usage

### Performance
- Skeleton loaders prevent layout shift
- Lazy loading of agent responses
- Efficient streaming for chat messages
